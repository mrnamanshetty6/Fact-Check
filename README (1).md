# FactCheck-Fake-News-Detection
Fake News contains misleading information that could be checked. This maintains lie about a certain statistic in a country or exaggerated cost of certain services for a country, which may arise unrest for some countries like in Arabic spring. There are organizations, like the House of Commons and the Crosscheck project, trying to deal with issues as confirming authors are accountable. However, their scope is so limited because they depend on human manual detection, in a globe with millions of articles either removed or being published every minute, this cannot be accountable or feasible manually. A solution could be, by the development of a system to provide a credible automated index scoring, or rating for credibility of different publishers, and news context. This paper proposes a methodology to create a model that will detect if an article is authentic or fake based on its words, phrases, sources and titles, by applying supervised machine learning algorithms on an annotated (labeled) dataset that are manually classified and guaranteed. Then, feature selection methods are applied to experiment and choose the best fit features to obtain the highest precision, according to confusion matrix results. We propose to create the model using different classification algorithms. The product model will test the unseen data, the results will be plotted, and accordingly, the product will be a model that detects and classifies fake articles and can be used and integrated with any system for future use.
